<!-- This is an outline of what the ExamineNetworksProcess can display. It's not used by any code,
but may come in handy in understanding the structure and interrelationship of the data.

Different data is available for different API levels.

This version outlines an output when a dual-sim phone is connected to mobile data for internet.

Notice that I have no means of identifying which SIM card is being used for mobile data.
I can't connect it to any of the CellInfo listed and the API does not make visible any
    straightforward means.

        <!-- cellInfo entries come in different types. They all have only a few common fields;
            each type has its own properties available exclusively to it.

            Signal Strength is in dBm.
            Signal Overall Quality is on a scale of 0 to 4.
            Blank fields are unavailable.
